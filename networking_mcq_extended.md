**36. In STP, what is the default bridge priority value on Cisco switches?**  
a) 4096  
b) 8192  
c) 32768  
d) 65536  

**Correct Answer:** c) 32768  
**Explanation:**  
- Default bridge priority is 32768 on Cisco switches
- Bridge ID = Priority + MAC address (lower wins root election)
- Priority can be configured in increments of 4096

---

**37. A network has 4 switches connected in a square topology with redundant links. If all switches have default priority but SW1 has MAC address 00:01:02:03:04:05, SW2 has 00:02:03:04:05:06, SW3 has 00:03:04:05:06:07, and SW4 has 00:04:05:06:07:08, which will be the root bridge?**  
a) SW1  
b) SW2  
c) SW3  
d) SW4  

**Correct Answer:** a) SW1  
**Explanation:**  
- All have same priority (32768), so lowest MAC address wins
- SW1 has lowest MAC: 00:01:02:03:04:05
- Root bridge election: Priority first, then MAC address

---

**38. In the network topology below, count the broadcast and collision domains:**
```
[PC1]---[Hub]---[SW1]---[SW2]---[Router]---[SW3]---[PC2]
            |                        |
          [PC3]                   [PC4]
```
a) Broadcast=2, Collision=4  
b) Broadcast=2, Collision=5  
c) Broadcast=2, Collision=6  
d) Broadcast=3, Collision=5  

Correct Answer:c) Broadcast=2, Collision=6

**Explanation:**

* **Collision Domains:**

  * Hub creates 1 shared domain (**PC1, PC3, Hub, SW1 port**)
  * SW1–SW2 link = 1
  * SW2–Router = 1
  * SW2–PC4 = 1 
  * Router–SW3 = 1
  * SW3–PC2 = 1
    → **Total = 6 collision domains**

* **Broadcast Domains:**

  * Left of router = 1
  * Right of router = 1
    → **Total = 2 broadcast domains**

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Broadcast = 2, Collision = 6** ✔️ (Option **c**)

## Quick Reference - STP Calculations

**Root Bridge Election:**
1. Lowest Bridge Priority (default 32768)
2. Lowest MAC address (tiebreaker)

**Port States (Traditional STP):**
- **Blocking:** 20 seconds - Receives BPDUs only
- **Listening:** 15 seconds - Processes BPDUs, no data
- **Learning:** 15 seconds - Learns MACs, no forwarding  
- **Forwarding:** Normal operation

**Path Cost (IEEE Standard):**
- 10 Mbps = 100
- 100 Mbps = 19  
- 1 Gbps = 4
- 10 Gbps = 2

## Domain Counting Rules

**Collision Domains:**
- Each switch port = 1 collision domain
- Hub = 1 collision domain (all connected devices)
- Router port = 1 collision domain

**Broadcast Domains:**  
- Router separates broadcast domains
- Each VLAN = 1 broadcast domain
- Default: All switch ports in same broadcast domain (VLAN 1)
